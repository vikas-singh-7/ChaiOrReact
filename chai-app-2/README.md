# React + Vite

 # here we just learnt abt useState hook why we need this hook 

 <h3>simply when we want to update any variable in react and also we want that okay when we just ypdate the variable so everywhere in the UI whre that varisble is used will automativally get update so we use useState hook</h3>

 <h3><i> so when we use useState hook we use a prebuilt function named <b>useState()</b> it takes a argument as the itial value of our variable.and this function return us a array having two elements one is <b>variable itself</b> and another is a <b>setVariable function</b> this <b>setVariable</b> allows us to change the value of variable <b>how</b> like <b>setVariable(new value of variable)</b> so with this setVariable we can change the value of our variable and when we use this updater ot wull automatically makes the variable value change wherever that variable is used </i></h3>
